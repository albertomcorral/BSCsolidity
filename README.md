# NFT Project

With the intention of driving a PoC for the business school where I graduated as Executive MBA, I developed a smart contract to deploy NFTs.
I used this smart contract to make an NFT out of the MBA diploma (deployed to the Polygon network).
A lot of the code was imported or is based from OpenZeppelin material. My deepest appreciation for them and the work they are doing.
